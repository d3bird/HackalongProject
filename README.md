# HackalongProject

This was uploaded for the twitch Hackalong stream. Git was having trouble uploading the app, so there may be some problems with missing code segments.

Do you love board games, but can never get all of you friends together then this is the app for you!

I have learned that over the years, getting a group of friends into the same room to play games is like heading cats. So instead of having to text each person separately, I decided to create an app that would do that for me.
## What it does
The app keeps track of different events that you plan to have. It saves the data to a document on the phone that auto imports into the app when it is started and is exported when the app is closed. When you open the app, you can choose to send a massive text blast to everyone who is invited.

## things to note

I have noticed that big sections of the code will not seem to upload. I am working to fix this problem as soon as possible.
